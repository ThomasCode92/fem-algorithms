# FrontendMaster - The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need

A super fun, beginner-friendly data structures and algorithms course. ðŸŽ“<br /> Is it really the last algorithms course you'll need? If you want to pass tough interview questions, then yes! ðŸ¤”<br />Learn about _Big O_, _time complexity_, fundamental data structures like arrays, lists, trees, graphs, and maps. Even searching and sorting algorithms. ðŸ’¡ðŸ“š

**About this Repository**<br />This repository is associated with [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) course from [FrontendMasters](https://frontendmasters.com/), taught by [ThePrimeagen](https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen).<br />Here, you'll find all the exercises, example algorithms, and data structures covered in the course.

### Testing the Algorithms & Data Structures

To run the algorithms and data structures tests, ensure Node.js is installed on the system. Refer to the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en) for installation instructions. If [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) is being used, Node.js can also be installed via the `.tool-versions` file. More information on this is available [here](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/configuration.html#tool-versions).

Once Node.js is installed, follow these steps to set up and test the application:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThomasCode92/fem-algorithms.git
cd fem-algorithms   # navigate into project folder
npm install         # install dependencies
npm run test        # run all unit tests
```

Ro run tests for a specific file, use the following command: `npx jest <FILE>`. For example, to test the _QuickSort_ implementation, run: `npx jest QuickSort`.

**Contributing**<br />Please note that some files in the [.src folder](./src/) have not been implemented yet. Contributions are welcome, and those interested in enhancing the project can fork the repository, implement the missing functionality, and submit a pull request. This will help improve the overall quality of the project.
