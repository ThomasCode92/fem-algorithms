-   **General Tree** - A Tree with 0 or more children
-   **Binary Search Tree** - A Tree which has a specific ordering to the Nodes and at most 2 children
-   **Leaves** - A Node without children
-   **Balanced** A Tree is perfectly _balanced_ when any Node's left and right children have the same height.
-   **Branching Factor** - The amount of children a Tree has.
